# Plants Recognition

## Goal:

The project goal was to produce a model (using Deep Learning) that identifies the plant in the image received, which can be root, nuts, fruits or vegetables.

## Dataset:

For this project I used a dataset with 90380 images of 131 fruits and vegetables from Kaggle (Fruits 360, More information visite: https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits). 

Dataset properties:
- The total number of images: 90483;
- Training set size: 67692 images;
- Test set size: 22688 images;
- The number of classes: 131;
- Image size: 100x100 pixels;
- Filename format: '.jpg'.
